# Fetch libssh2 and link it into a target for SSH-tunnel support.
#
# Called only when the QUAERO_SSH option is ON. libssh2 is built as a static
# library with a platform crypto backend that needs no extra vendored dependency:
# WinCNG (built into Windows) on Windows, the system OpenSSL elsewhere.
#
# libssh2's CMakeLists declares an older cmake_minimum_required, so inside its
# scope policy CMP0077 is OLD and option() overrides plain variables. We must
# therefore steer its build through CACHE variables, not normal ones. BUILD_TESTING
# is the one cache var we must not leave flipped (it also gates OUR tests), so we
# save and restore it around the fetch.
